// A Binary (Max) Heap is a complete binary tree that 
// maintains the Max Heap property.


// Binary Heap is one possible data structure to model 
// an efficient Priority Queue (PQ) Abstract Data Type (ADT). In a PQ, each element has a "priority" and an element with higher priority is served before an element with lower priority (ties are broken with standard First-In First-Out (FIFO) rule as with normal Queue). Try clicking ExtractMax() for a sample animation on extracting the max value of random Binary Heap above.


// To focus the discussion scope, this visualization 
// show a Binary Max Heap of integers where duplicates 
// are allowed. See this for an easy conversion to Binary
//  Min Heap.

// The big O notaiton of a binary heap 
// lookup O(n)
// insert O(log N)
// delete O(log N)

// In binary heap the parent is always greater than
// the children
// It is used in prority queue

// Binary heaps
// 
// Pros
// Better than O(n)
// Can be used in priority
// It has flexible size
// It has fast insert

// Cons
// It has slow lookups
