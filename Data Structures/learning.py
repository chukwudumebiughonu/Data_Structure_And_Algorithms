# Introduction
# A Programing language is a group of syntax which are 
# used to give a computer an instruction to perform
# certain action

# Python as a programing language
# Python was developed by Guido von Rosum in 1990 and 
# got its name from a commedy show called mounty 
# python 

# Computer understand binary operation in the form of 
# ones and zeros however to interect with the computer 
# and give them instruction humans has to find a way 
# to do so as humans can not understand ones and 
# zero, so there was a need to create a language that 
# would take the instructions from human being and 
# translate it into something the computer would understand
# To do that python is on of the language that can translate our 
# human instruction into something the computer would easily
# Understand, it does so with the help of something called
# the interpreter

# The interpreter
# The interpreter is one way by which human instruction is 
# translated to the language a computer machine can understand. 
# What the interpreter doses is take the instruction given to it,
# it reads it one line at a time and execute the task according 
# to each line of instruction. Python is one language that uses an
# interpreter 

# The workflow of how python does execute a program
# You type in the appropriate command in python script,
# shell or ide
# Python the interpretes your instruction using the interpreter
# The interpreter then converts the instructions to byte code
# These instruction is then run by cpython an implementation of python programing language
# Which the convert the instruction to one and zeros which the computer understand

# print('Chukwudumebi Ughonu')
# name = input('What is your name? ')
# print('welcome '+ name)

# Four key thing to master in learning a new language
# The term
# The language data type, that is the values 
# The actions of the programming language
# The best practices of each language- that is the best
# way to write code in the 
# 

# Python Data types
# A data type is a value in a program
# The fundamenta data type include
# int- short for integer
# float
# bool- short for boolean
# str - short for string
# list
# tuple
# set
# dict - short form for dictionary

# Other form of data type includes the custom data typess
# such as ;
# Classes
# Specialized data types
# None

# The first data type
# int- Integer
# Float

# Integer
